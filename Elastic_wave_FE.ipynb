    "### Step 1: Continuum Mechanics Foundations\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin with the 1D motion of an elastic body governed by Newton's second law, which in its continuum form is represented as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\rho \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial t^2} = \\frac{\\partial \\sigma}{\\partial x} + f $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $ u(x,t) $ is the displacement field,\n",
    "- $ \\rho $ is the density of the material,\n",
    "- $ \\sigma $ is the stress in the material,\n",
    "- $ f $ is the body force per unit volume (e.g., gravity),\n",
    "- $ x $ is the spatial coordinate,\n",
    "- $ t $ is time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Stress-Strain Relationship\n",
    "\n",
    "In a 1D elastic medium, stress $ \\sigma $ is related to strain $ \\epsilon $ by Hooke's law:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\sigma = E \\epsilon $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $ E $ is the Young's modulus of the material, and strain $ \\epsilon $ is the derivative of displacement:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\epsilon = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Weak Formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "To apply FEM, we convert the strong form (differential equation) into a weak form by multiplying with a test function $ v(x) $ (also known as the weighting function) and integrating over the domain $ \\Omega $:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\int_\\Omega \\rho v \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial t^2} \\, dx = \\int_\\Omega v \\frac{\\partial \\sigma}{\\partial x} \\, dx + \\int_\\Omega v f \\, dx $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Integrating the stress term by parts and applying the boundary conditions, we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\int_\\Omega \\rho v \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial t^2} \\, dx + \\int_\\Omega \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} \\sigma \\, dx = \\int_\\Omega v f \\, dx + [v \\sigma]_{\\partial \\Omega} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $ [v \\sigma]_{\\partial \\Omega} $ represents the boundary terms which must be treated separately based on specific boundary conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Discretization\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we discretize the domain $ \\Omega $ into finite elements. The displacement field $ u(x,t) $ and the test function $ v(x) $ are approximated by the finite element basis functions $ N_i(x) $, such that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ u(x,t) \\approx \\sum_{i=1}^n N_i(x) u_i(t) $$\n",
    "$$ v(x) \\approx \\sum_{i=1}^n N_i(x) v_i $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $ u_i(t) $ are the nodal displacements and $ v_i $ are the corresponding test function values at the nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5: Matrix Formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Substituting the discretized forms of $ u $ and $ v $ into the weak form and performing the integrations, we obtain a system of ordinary differential equations in matrix form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ M \\ddot{U}(t) + K U(t) = F(t) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $ M $ is the mass matrix, $ M_{ij} = \\int_\\Omega \\rho N_i N_j \\, dx $,\n",
    "- $ K $ is the stiffness matrix, $ K_{ij} = \\int_\\Omega E \\frac{\\partial N_i}{\\partial x} \\frac{\\partial N_j}{\\partial x} \\, dx $,\n",
    "- $ U(t) $ is the vector of nodal displacements,\n",
    "- $ \\ddot{U}(t) $ is the second time derivative of $ U(t) $,\n",
    "- $ F(t) $ is the vector of external forces.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 6: Time Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "The final step is to solve the matrix ODE using a time integration scheme (e.g., Newmark-beta, Central Difference Method) to find the displacements $ U(t) $ at each time step."

    "## Basis Function/Test Function\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Finite Element Method (FEM), the choice of basis functions is critical as it determines the approximation capabilities of the method and the numerical properties of the resulting system of equations. For a 1D elastic wave problem, the most common basis functions are polynomial functions, with linear and quadratic polynomials being the most commonly used for their simplicity and good balance between accuracy and computational efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is how you can choose and use these basis functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Linear Basis Functions (Linear Elements)\n",
    "For linear elements, also known as \"hat\" functions, each element has two nodes, and the basis functions are linear polynomials that are equal to 1 at their respective node and 0 at all other nodes in the mesh. The basis functions $ N_i(x) $ for a linear element can be defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- For node $ i $, $ N_i(x) = \\frac{x - x_{i-1}}{x_i - x_{i-1}} $ for $ x $ in element $ i-1/i $, and 0 otherwise.\n",
    "- For node $ i+1 $, $ N_{i+1}(x) = \\frac{x_{i+1} - x}{x_{i+1} - x_i} $ for $ x $ in element $ i/i+1 $, and 0 otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quadratic Basis Functions (Quadratic Elements)\n",
    "For quadratic elements, there are three nodes per element: two at the ends and one at the midpoint. The basis functions for a quadratic element can be defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- For the first node $ i $, $ N_i(x) = \\frac{(x - x_{i+1})(x - x_m)}{(x_i - x_{i+1})(x_i - x_m)} $ where $ x_m $ is the midpoint.\n",
    "- For the midpoint node $ m $, $ N_m(x) = \\frac{(x - x_i)(x - x_{i+1})}{(x_m - x_i)(x_m - x_{i+1})} $.\n",
    "- For the last node $ i+1 $, $ N_{i+1}(x) = \\frac{(x - x_i)(x - x_m)}{(x_{i+1} - x_i)(x_{i+1} - x_m)} $.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Choosing the Basis Function\n",
    "The choice between linear and quadratic basis functions (or higher-order polynomials) depends on the following factors:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Problem Requirements:** If the solution is expected to be smooth, linear elements may suffice. If the solution has higher gradients or curvature, quadratic or higher-order elements may be required.\n",
    "- **Computational Resources:** Higher-order elements will require more computational resources.\n",
    "- **Convergence Needs:** Higher-order elements can achieve a given level of accuracy with fewer elements (though each element is more complex).\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, you start with the simplest element type that you believe will capture the essential features of the solution. Then, if necessary, you increase the complexity of the elements or refine the mesh until the solution converges to an acceptable level of accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of FEM for elastic waves, the wave behavior can often be well represented by linear elements, but if there are sharp changes or features in the material properties or if high accuracy is needed in capturing the wavefront, then quadratic or higher-order elements may be more appropriate."
