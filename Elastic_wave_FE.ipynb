    "### Step 1: Continuum Mechanics Foundations\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin with the 1D motion of an elastic body governed by Newton's second law, which in its continuum form is represented as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\rho \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial t^2} = \\frac{\\partial \\sigma}{\\partial x} + f $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $ u(x,t) $ is the displacement field,\n",
    "- $ \\rho $ is the density of the material,\n",
    "- $ \\sigma $ is the stress in the material,\n",
    "- $ f $ is the body force per unit volume (e.g., gravity),\n",
    "- $ x $ is the spatial coordinate,\n",
    "- $ t $ is time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Stress-Strain Relationship\n",
    "\n",
    "In a 1D elastic medium, stress $ \\sigma $ is related to strain $ \\epsilon $ by Hooke's law:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\sigma = E \\epsilon $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $ E $ is the Young's modulus of the material, and strain $ \\epsilon $ is the derivative of displacement:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\epsilon = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Weak Formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "To apply FEM, we convert the strong form (differential equation) into a weak form by multiplying with a test function $ v(x) $ (also known as the weighting function) and integrating over the domain $ \\Omega $:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\int_\\Omega \\rho v \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial t^2} \\, dx = \\int_\\Omega v \\frac{\\partial \\sigma}{\\partial x} \\, dx + \\int_\\Omega v f \\, dx $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Integrating the stress term by parts and applying the boundary conditions, we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\int_\\Omega \\rho v \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial t^2} \\, dx + \\int_\\Omega \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} \\sigma \\, dx = \\int_\\Omega v f \\, dx + [v \\sigma]_{\\partial \\Omega} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $ [v \\sigma]_{\\partial \\Omega} $ represents the boundary terms which must be treated separately based on specific boundary conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Discretization\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we discretize the domain $ \\Omega $ into finite elements. The displacement field $ u(x,t) $ and the test function $ v(x) $ are approximated by the finite element basis functions $ N_i(x) $, such that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ u(x,t) \\approx \\sum_{i=1}^n N_i(x) u_i(t) $$\n",
    "$$ v(x) \\approx \\sum_{i=1}^n N_i(x) v_i $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $ u_i(t) $ are the nodal displacements and $ v_i $ are the corresponding test function values at the nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5: Matrix Formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Substituting the discretized forms of $ u $ and $ v $ into the weak form and performing the integrations, we obtain a system of ordinary differential equations in matrix form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ M \\ddot{U}(t) + K U(t) = F(t) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $ M $ is the mass matrix, $ M_{ij} = \\int_\\Omega \\rho N_i N_j \\, dx $,\n",
    "- $ K $ is the stiffness matrix, $ K_{ij} = \\int_\\Omega E \\frac{\\partial N_i}{\\partial x} \\frac{\\partial N_j}{\\partial x} \\, dx $,\n",
    "- $ U(t) $ is the vector of nodal displacements,\n",
    "- $ \\ddot{U}(t) $ is the second time derivative of $ U(t) $,\n",
    "- $ F(t) $ is the vector of external forces.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 6: Time Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "The final step is to solve the matrix ODE using a time integration scheme (e.g., Newmark-beta, Central Difference Method) to find the displacements $ U(t) $ at each time step.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a high-level overview of the derivation process, which involves continuum mechanics, a stress-strain relationship, a weak formulation of the governing equations, domain discretization using finite elements, and the assembly of a system of equations solved using numerical methods. Each of these steps requires a detailed understanding of both the physical principles involved and the numerical methods used."
